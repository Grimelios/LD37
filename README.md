### Ludum Dare 37 ###

Small video game created for Ludum Dare 37. The theme for LD37 was **One Room**. The game was created from scratch in 72 hours. To fit the theme, I designed a portal-style puzzle game that takes place in a single room. Rather than exiting through doors, panels in the back of the room flip between each puzzle to reveal the next one.
